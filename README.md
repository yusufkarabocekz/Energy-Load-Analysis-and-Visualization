## Introduction

Energy management is crucial for efficient use of resources. This project provides a simple yet effective way to analyze energy load data over a specified time period.
The key metrics calculated include total energy consumption, average load, peak load, and load factor.
Additionally, the results are visualized using a bar graph to provide a clear understanding of the energy usage pattern.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the code.

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2020a or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-load-analysis.git

### Usage

1. Open the MATLAB script containing the code (e.g., energy_load_analysis.m).

2. Run the script. The code will:

 • Read the energy load data from a predefined matrix.
 
 • Calculate the total energy, average load, peak load, and load factor.
 
 • Display the results.
 
 • Generate a bar graph to visualize the energy load over time.
